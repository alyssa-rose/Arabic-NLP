# NLP-Projects
Personal projects focused on natural language processing

Word segmentation done via use of Stanford NLP Group's Arabic segmenter for the seperation of clitics from words

Word tokenization done with nltk's word_tokenize

Word embedding occurs in the first layer of the long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural net using Keras' Embedding, mapping the tokens to a vector space in R^10
